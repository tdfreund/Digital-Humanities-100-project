# Digital-Humanities-100-project
## Project Description:
This project explores a dataset collected from a series of speed dating events.  The variables from this dataset that I am interested in are choice of Major and attribute preferences.  First, I investigate the relationship between major of choice and attribute preferences in potential partners to determine if STEM majors are systematically different than non-STEM major in terms of what they seek in a partner.  Second, I identify which majors value the intelligence attribute most highly and which majors value the attractiveness attribute most highly. 

## Tools and Methods
Speed dating dataset downloaded from kaggle.

Jupyter notebook from google colab used for exploratory data analysis (T-test on STEM vs. non-STEM major attribute preferences) and visualization creation (Bar Charts/Bubble Charts/Histograms identifying of majors that value intelligence most vs. attractiveness most).

Poster made on lucidchart providing in depth description of project and results.
